                <h4 class="text-black-50">THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS</h4>

                <p>Our Third Party Suppliers, such as airlines, hotels, and tour operators, are not employees or agents
                    of BLUEJAYS TRAVEL AND TOURS but independent contractors. Your interaction with our Third Party
                    Suppliers through this Website is at your own risk, and BLUEJAYS TRAVEL AND TOURS will have no
                    liability with respect to the acts, omissions, errors, representations, warranties, breaches or
                    negligence of any of our Third Party Suppliers or for any personal injuries, death, property damage,
                    or other damages or expenses resulting from your interactions with our Third Party Suppliers.</p>

                <p>In addition to your obligations under these Terms and Conditions, you are also bound by the rules and
                    restrictions of our Third Party Suppliers such as, but not limited to, those found in the contract
                    of carriage with airline companies, hotel terms and conditions, and credit card policies, as the
                    case may be. Violation of these additional rules may result in cancellation of your reservation(s),
                    denial of access to the applicable travel products or services, forfeiture of monies paid for such
                    reservation, and/or in our debiting your account for any costs we incur as a result of such
                    violation.</p>

                <p>The circumvention of airline rules, including practices such as back-to-back ticketing (purchasing
                    two or more tickets with overlapping travel dates in order to circumvent minimum stay requirements)
                    and hidden-city ticketing (purchasing tickets including segments which the purchaser does not intend
                    to use in order to circumvent an air carrier's pricing structure), is prohibited by several
                    airlines. The use of prohibited ticketing practices may result in the cancellation of the ticket,
                    denial of boarding, revocation of frequent flier miles and other benefits, additional charges to the
                    purchaser's credit card, additional charges collected at the airport, or future invoicing. You are
                    responsible for ensuring that the flight you booked do not violate any airline contract of carriage.
                </p>

                <p>Some of our Third Party Suppliers require you to sign their liability waiver prior to participating
                    in the service they offer. You are free to refuse to execute the liability waiver. However, such
                    refusal shall result in you not being able to participate in the particular service where you agree
                    not to execute a waiver.</p>

                <p>We reserve the right to cancel your booking if full payment is not received in a timely fashion. Some
                    Third Party Suppliers like hotels, car rentals or tour operators may require you to present a credit
                    card or cash deposit intended to cover additional expenses. Such deposit is not connected with the
                    payment made to BLUEJAYS TRAVEL AND TOURS at the time you made your booking.</p>

                <p>You may also modify or cancel your travel booking, subject to the applicable fees charged and refund
                    policies of our respective Third Party Supplier.</p>
